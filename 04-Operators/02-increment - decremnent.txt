increment and derememnt operators are used to increase. decrease 
the value of a variable by 1 

let age = 25 

age++; 

console.log(age) // this will now give me 26 

// age++ basically just adds 1, and always only 1. 

// Difference between post and pre increment/ decrement 
let i = 10; 

let j = i++; // increase i by one but not at this moment, add 
it on the next use 

console.log(`I value is ${i} and J value is ${j}`) // 11-10

there is a differece when you add the ++ or -- before or after so there
is pre and post 

when you add the ++ before the value, then it will add 1 right away 
++1 -> this is the perferred way because it add 1 right away

example - 
let counter = 5; 

let result = counter++; // counter = 5, result = 5 

console.log(++counter * result); // (7 * 5) = result is 35
