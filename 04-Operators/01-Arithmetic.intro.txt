// exponentiation (is basically power)

console.log(3 ** 2); // 9
console.log(4 ** 3); // 64 
console.log(2 ** 5) / 4 + 3 

Order of operation 
1. Exponentation 
2. Parantheses
3. Multiplication/ Division 
    3.5 Remainder %
4. Addition/ Subtraction 

Remainder/ Modulus 
1. You basically divide and whatever is left is the answer
    example ; 12 % 5 = 2 // Because you can fit 2 5s in 12 then you have 2 left 

2. If the number on the left is smaller than the one on the right 
    Remainder will be left number itself 
        8 % 9 = 8 
        100 % 9800 = 100 
3. If the number on the left is bigger than the right and not divisable by the 
Remainder will be more than zero but less than the number on the right 
    23 % 7 = 2 
    27 % 7 = 6 
    28 % 7 = 0
