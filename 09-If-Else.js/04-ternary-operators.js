//Ternary is percise way of making if else statements (shorter, nicer) and stores it into a variable

let examScore = 59;

let result = examScore >= 60 ? 'PASS' : 'FAILED';

console.log(result); 

//practice 

let age = 67;
let retirementAllowed = age >= 65 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
console.log(retirementAllowed); // YES

let age2 = 67;
let retirementAllowed2 = age2 <= 65 ? 'No' : 'Yes';
console.log(retirementAllowed2); // YES

// The question mark is like the IF and the : is like the ELSE. 
// Then the first expression is the true and the second is the false
